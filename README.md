# Expense Tracker

Welcome!

Checkout the deployed app! https://e-tracker.herokuapp.com/

Expense Tracker is an app for keeping track of all your expenses. With the app, users can create monthly budgets for themselves and make sure they're staying within their spedning range by also creating expenses. These expenses go into their own budgets and can be edited or deleted.

The home page screams "Welcome!" and a user has to log-in in order to get started viewing and using the website.

Budget Page

The budget page is like the expenses page. It has all of the budgets that the user has created. The user can also click on each budget to view its details and all the expenses that have gone within it. The user can also search through their database to find what their looking for.
